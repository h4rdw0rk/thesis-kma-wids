  able to carry their laptop to the conference room down the hall and
  still have complete network access without worrying about network
  cables? Manufacturing companies are even using wireless LANs (WLANs)
  to monitor shop-floor machinery that is not traditionally accessible
  by network cabling. Increased mobility and accessibility improves
  communication, productivity, and efficiency. How much more productive
  could a team meeting be if all participants meeting in the conference
  room still had access to the network and the files relating to the
  project being discussed?},

  unique collection details how to conduct digital investigations in
  both criminal and civil contexts, and how to locate and utilize digital
  evidence on computers, networks, and embedded systems. Specifically,
  the Investigative Methodology section of the Handbook provides expert
  guidance in the three main areas of practice: Forensic Analysis,
  Electronic Discovery and Intrusion Investigation. The Technology
  section is extended and updated to reflect the state of the art in
  each area of specialization. The main areas of focus in the Technology
  section are forensic analysis of Windows, Unix, Macintosh, and embedded
  systems (including cellular telephones and other mobile devices),
  and investigations involving networks (including enterprise environments
  and mobile telecommunications technology).The Handbook of Digital
  Forensics and Investigation is an essential technical reference and
  on-the-job guide that IT professionals, forensic practitioners, law
  enforcement, and attorneys will rely on when confronted with computer
  related crime and digital evidence of any kind. *Provides methodologies
  proven in practice for conducting digital investigations of all kinds*Demonstrates
  how to locate and interpret a wide variety of digital evidence, and
  how it can be useful in investigations *Presents tools in the context
  of the investigative process, including EnCase, FTK, ProDiscover,

  is only as secure as its weakest link. There are several layers of
  security and different measures that can currently be implemented.
  However, they lack coordination, and therefore potential security
  breaches might compromise the network. With wireless access becoming
  the norm, and users requiring �on the move communication� even within
  a campus, networks are expanding past the traditional wired networks
  by adding wireless access points. This gives customers the flexibility
  they require but leaves a net threat vector to the network. There
  have been various encryption and security steps taken to validate
  the communication and authentication of the devices and end users
  connecting. This project addresses the critical problem of secure
  authentication using the 802.1x standard, which will be implemented
  using Microsoft's Radius server elements. It will involve the enrollment
  of secure certificates on Windows mobile devices, thus securing mobile
  devices from physical attacks. To ensure that all steps are adhered
  to, that all necessary applications have been installed, and to handle
  Web service communication, an application will be created that will
  provide an automated solution. },

  it is clear from their past occurrences that cybercrimes pose a serious
  threat to our long-term welfare. This article focuses on the current
  relationship between networked systems and cybercrimes, analyzes
  the nature of the relationship from a fundamental engineering perspective,
  and systematically explores where and how future advances in networked
  systems might influence the evolution of cyber-attacks, even inadvertently
  giving rise to new forms of cybercrimes. Historical data reveals
  that technological advances in engineering systems design, including
  communications and transportation, were often accompanied by lack
  of foresight, thereby inadvertently opening doors to new forms of
  vulnerabilities following deployment. The greater the extent of the
  advancement, the deeper the potential chasm and more severe the damage
  incurred when a clever perpetrator successfully exploits the weaknesses.
  For example, when the Bell Telephone System employed human operators
  to switch telephone calls in the early 1900s, anonymous and unauthorized
  long-distance calls were a rarity. As soon as automatic switching
  equipment replaced human operators, �phone phreaks�1 discovered a
  serious flaw in the system. First by simply whistling or using a
  toy whistle and later through utilizing a tone-generating bluebox,
  one could break into the signaling control and make unauthorized
  long-distance calls. },

  computing resources as on-demand services over the Internet. Like
  all forms of outsourcing, cloud computing raises serious concerns
  about the security of the data assets that are outsourced to providers
  of cloud services. To address these security concerns, we show how
  today's generation of information security management systems (ISMSs),
  as specified in the ISO/IEC 27001:2005, must be extended to address
  the transfer of security controls into cloud environments. The resulting
  virtual ISMS is a standards-compliant management approach for developing
  a sound control environment while supporting the various modalities
  of cloud computing. This article addresses chief security and/or
  information officers of cloud client and cloud provider organizations.
  Cloud clients will benefit from our exposition of how to manage risk
  when corporate assets are outsourced to cloud providers. Providers
  of cloud services will learn what processes and controls they can
  offer in order to provide superior security that differentiates their
  offerings in the market. },
